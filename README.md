Hello !!! I'm working on a project making a Smart Medicine Dispenser called MediBox and I will be testing and sharing step buy step to do so. This is the first step where we make the motor move 270 degree every one hour. It can be changed according to your requirements. I will be adding a YT video too , make sure you check it out too !!
